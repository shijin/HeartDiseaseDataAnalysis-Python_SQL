# Heart Disease Analysis Project

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset obtained from Kaggle. It was conducted to uncover key insights into factors contributing to heart disease using Python-based tools and libraries.

## Project Objective

To analyze health-related data to identify significant patterns and correlations that indicate a higher risk of heart disease. This analysis is intended to demonstrate real-world application of data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation using Python.

## Dataset Overview

Source: Kaggle (UCI Heart Disease dataset)

Records: 918

Features: Age, cholesterol, chest pain type, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, thalassemia, etc.

## Tools and Libraries

Python 3

Pandas

Numpy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

MySQL

## Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, identified outliers (e.g., cholesterol = 0)

2. **Exploratory Analysis**:

Distribution of age, cholesterol, heart rate

Countplots of categorical features like chest pain, fasting blood sugar

3. **Correlation Analysis**:

Correlation matrix to identify strongest predictors

Observed that oldpeak and fasting blood sugar positively correlate with heart disease

max heart rate and cholesterol showed a negative correlation

4. **Insights & Conclusion**: Summarized key medical trends and analytical outcomes
